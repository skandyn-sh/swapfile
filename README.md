# swapfile

This is my swapfile script for Debian

This script creates and activates a swap file (path: /swapfile) and then adds it to /etc/fstab

This script allows you to select the size of the 1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB and 16 GB swap file

Installation

Clone or download

git clone  https://github.com/skandyn-sh/swapfile.git  

sh swapfile.sh

Enjoy

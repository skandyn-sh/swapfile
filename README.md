# swapfile

This is my swapfile script for Debian

This script creates and activates a swap file (path: /swapfile) and then adds it to /etc/fstab

This script gives you the option to choose the size of a 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 8GB and 16GB swap file

Installation

Clone or download

git clone  https://github.com/skandyn-sh/swapfile.git  

sh swapfile.sh

Enjoy
